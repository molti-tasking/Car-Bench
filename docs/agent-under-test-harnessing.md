# Building Sophisticated Agent Under Test Harnesses

This repository evaluates an **agent under test** through A2A. The evaluator owns
CAR-bench: task loading, tool filtering, tool execution, simulated user turns,
trajectory recording, and rewards. An agent under test only needs to decide the next
assistant step and return it in the expected A2A shape.

For the full shared A2A message and metadata contract, start with
[`development-guide.md`](development-guide.md). This document focuses on
higher-level harness architecture and extension patterns.

## A2A Contract

The evaluator sends one A2A message per assistant step:

- First turn: a `TextPart` containing `System: <wiki>\n\nUser: <request>` plus a
  `DataPart` containing `{"tools": [...]}` in OpenAI function-calling format.
- Tool-result turn: a `DataPart` containing `{"tool_results": [...]}`.
- User follow-up turn: a `TextPart` containing the simulated user's next message.

The agent under test returns one A2A message:

- User-facing response: `TextPart("...")`.
- Tool call response: `DataPart({"tool_calls": [{"tool_name": "...", "arguments": {...}}]})`.
- Optional debug reasoning: `DataPart({"reasoning_content": "..."})`.

The evaluator wrapper converts these A2A parts back into the OpenAI-style assistant
message format expected by CAR-bench core. Do not execute vehicle tools inside
the agent under test; doing so bypasses the benchmark.

## Harness Pattern

A robust agent-under-test harness usually has four layers:

1. **A2A parser**: Reads `TextPart` and `DataPart`, extracts the system prompt,
   user text, tool definitions, and tool results.
2. **Conversation store**: Maintains per-`context_id` history. This prevents one
   benchmark task from leaking into another.
3. **Inference adapter**: Calls your model/runtime and asks for one next action:
   either tool calls or a user-facing response.
4. **A2A renderer**: Converts the model output into `TextPart`/`DataPart` while
   attaching optional turn metrics.

The Codex implementation in `src/agent_under_test_codex/` follows this
shape and keeps Codex-specific app-server details behind `codex_client.py`.
For Codex-specific model selection and multi-pass templates, see
`docs/codex-harness-patterns.md`. A concrete planner/executor reference agent
lives in `src/agent_under_test_codex_planner/`, and a Python-call DSL
reference agent lives in `src/agent_under_test_codex_python/`.

Reference packages:

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `src/agent_under_test/` | Minimal LiteLLM-compatible template agent. |
| `src/agent_under_test_codex/` | Codex app-server agent returning next-action JSON. |
| `src/agent_under_test_codex_planner/` | Private planner plus Spark executor. |
| `src/agent_under_test_codex_python/` | Python-call DSL parser inspired by programmatic tool calling. |

## Important Design Rules

- Preserve tool names, parameter names, and result text exactly as the evaluator provides
  them.
- Do not add convenience tools, hidden vehicle state reads, shell commands, file
  reads, or network tools to the benchmark decision loop.
- Pass through invalid CAR-bench tool calls rather than silently repairing them
  if you want hallucination and tool-execution metrics to remain comparable.
- Keep user interaction natural text. The simulated user is not an agent-under-test-side
  tool.
- Attach latency/token/cost metadata only when you can measure it reliably. It
  is acceptable to report token and cost fields as zero for runtimes that do
  not expose usage. Codex app-server exposes token usage via
  `thread/tokenUsage/updated`, but not reliable per-turn billing cost.

## Agentic Harness Boundaries

Participants may build sophisticated agent-under-test-side harnesses, but the benchmark
boundary is the A2A exchange with the evaluator. Your harness can:

- Run multiple internal model calls before choosing the next action.
- Add a planner, critic, reranker, validator, memory layer, or policy-check pass.
- Use sub-agent-style code inside your own participant container if each internal
  component only sees benchmark-allowed inputs: the system prompt, transcript,
  tool definitions, and tool results already sent by the evaluator.
- Swap Codex for another model/runtime while preserving the same A2A output
  contract.

Your harness must not:

- Execute CAR-bench vehicle tools directly; only the evaluator executes tools.
- Inspect CAR-bench files, hidden mock data, answer keys, task definitions, or
  evaluator internals to decide the next action.
- Add private vehicle-state tools, shell commands, file reads, browser/network
  tools, or simulated-user tools to the decision loop.
- Hide tool calls from the evaluator or convert unavailable tools into available ones in
  a way that prevents hallucination metrics from scoring the behavior.
- Let an external runtime perform uncontrolled side effects that change the
  benchmark state outside the recorded A2A trajectory.

## Codex Harness

The Codex agent under test uses a warm `codex app-server` process and asks for
schema-constrained final JSON:

```json
{"action": "respond", "content": "Sure, I can help with that.", "tool_calls": []}
```

or:

```json
{
  "action": "tool_calls",
  "content": "",
  "tool_calls": [
    {"tool_name": "get_weather", "arguments_json": "{\"location\":\"Munich\"}"}
  ]
}
```

Each Codex step gets the full CAR-bench transcript and the task-filtered tool
definitions. The app-server process stays warm, but each step uses an ephemeral
Codex thread so the model-visible context is explicit and reproducible.
`arguments_json` is decoded by the adapter before returning normal A2A
`{"tool_name": "...", "arguments": {...}}` payloads to the evaluator.

This Codex harness intentionally does not expose Codex's normal coding-agent
affordances to the benchmark turn. Dynamic tools, shell commands, file changes,
permission requests, network access, and user-input requests are denied by the
adapter. Codex is used here as a constrained next-action reasoning layer, not as
an unconstrained coding workspace or hidden multi-agent system.

## Extension Ideas

- Add pre-validation that warns on unknown tool names while still passing them
  through for benchmark scoring.
- Add a reranker or policy-check pass before returning the final A2A response.
- Use a budget-gated planner/executor or ensemble/condenser pattern, reserving
  larger models for risky turns and Spark-like models for the common case.
- Use CAR-bench's `planning_tool` shape, or your own planning tool/mode, as
  private internal reasoning. Keep it private unless you intentionally want
  the evaluator to execute and record `planning_tool` as a normal benchmark tool call.
- Use a parsed Python-call DSL as an alternative action representation. It can
  be extracted from a fenced code block in model chat text, but generated code
  must be parsed rather than executed and converted back into normal A2A output.
- Swap the inference adapter for another runtime while reusing the parser,
  conversation store, renderer, and metrics code.
- Add native dynamic tools only after the JSON-output MVP is stable; if you do,
  mirror every dynamic tool call back into the `tool_calls` DataPart shape so
  CAR-bench trajectories remain comparable.
